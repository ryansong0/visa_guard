"""
Visalify Benchmark Harness
--------------------------
Runs a labeled set of resume/job-description pairs against your live /match
endpoint and computes real, defensible metrics:

1. Hallucination rate: % of "clean" resumes (no managerial language) that
   incorrectly received a Regulatory Compliance Risk gap.
2. Detection recall: % of "management-heavy" resumes that correctly received
   a Regulatory Compliance Risk gap.
3. Score groundedness: % of cases where the final score stayed within a
   reasonable band of the resume/JD's expected match tier (high/medium/low).
4. Rewrite completeness: average length ratio of optimized_profile vs original
   (checks for truncation).
5. Banned-word leakage: % of management-heavy resumes whose rewrite STILL
   contains a banned supervisory word (managed/led/directed/overseeing/oversaw).

Usage:
    python benchmark_visalify.py

Requires: pip install requests --break-system-packages (if not already installed)
Requires your FastAPI backend running at http://127.0.0.1:8000
